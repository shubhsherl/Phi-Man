I saw a small boy standing in the woods and crying. I was confused to see a kid lost in woods as there are no houses nearby. I decided to drive away but the car refused to start. I immediately looked at the kid to see if he is still there. Hearing so many horror stories from the Father at the church, I was scared. Does he have eyes at the back? My watch says 6:36. Close to 6:66? All such questions popped into my head. But something in me also said he could be an innocent kid who is really lost.

The fear was stopping me to go near him. I decided to observe him from behind a tree. Just then the cries stopped. I could see him talking to someone. I was sure now. A couple got down from a car and spoke to the kid and then took him with them.

I felt ashamed for doubting him. I started walking towards the church. "6:36,666, eye at the back hahaha!!", I laughed. A bus went by. Friend from the bus texts me - "Going Into the woods? And who is this new kid on your shoulder?"
